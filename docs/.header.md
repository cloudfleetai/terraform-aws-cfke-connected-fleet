# CFKE Connected Fleet for AWS

This module installs the required IAM roles and policies, and sets up the VPC for the CFKE controller to manage the cluster.

VPCs are created in all the enabled regions of the AWS account. 

## Example usage

```terraform
module "cfke_connected_fleet" {
  source               = "registry.terraform.io/cloudfleetai/cfke-connected-fleet/aws"
  version              = "1.0.0"
  control_plane_region = "northamerica-central-1"
  cluster_id           = "ea4ba2ac-3262-4c51-9a08-e13c98e50aab"
}
```

## Service Linked Role for Spot instances

Unless your AWS account has already onboarded to EC2 Spot, you need to create the service linked role to avoid `ServiceLinkedRoleCreationNotPermitted` errors upon node provisioning. This module creates this role by default for you. However, if your account has already onboarded to EC2 Spot, you must disable creation of the role by setting `create_service_linked_role` to `false`.

You tell if this role exists if you see the following error message when you apply the module:

```shell
InvalidInput: Service role name AWSServiceRoleForEC2Spot has been taken in this account, please try a different suffix.
```

Please see the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/service-linked-roles-spot-instance-requests.html) for more information.
